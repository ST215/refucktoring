**About Refucktoring**

Make incremental changes to destroy the code, and keep the test cases green! As with Refactoring, make small changes line by line to your source file of choice, and run the tests after each change. The goal is unreadable code, obfuscated programs, maintenance nightmares, and slow running times.

To refucktor one of these projects, download or clone the folder, or choose a source code and its associated test suite. The source code file should have some comments with more information about the program to be Refucktored.

**The Code**

This code was chosen from reputable sources, such as RosettaCode.org and textbooks. This is not original code, and every effort has been made to credit the source in the readme accompanying each project.
This code is *intended to be messed with*, so please do not use it as a basis for anything serious.
